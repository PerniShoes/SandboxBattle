# Project_Template
Setting up C++ projects can be a pain as a newbie. Linker errors, issues with include directories, more linker errors and so on.

This allows for a quick setup for new projects.   
Just clone the repo and it works.

Features Engine from DAE GD course year 1. Tweaked a bit to my needs.
