### Duelyst Remake

Solo project covering almost the entirety of game development (excluding networking).

Self-made systems for animation, audio, combat, and more.  
Uses a lightweight framework for basic tasks (system input & simple rendering); everything else — from low-level engine code to gameplay, UI/UX, animation, asset loading, and file management — is built by yours truly :D
